/**
 * Pantheon Rewrites provides a way for you to create Apache redirects and mod_rewrites in
 * Drupal and Wordpress. Since Pantheon leverages Nginx for HTTP/HTTPS, redirects and rewrites in
 * your .htaccess file will not work.
 *
 * Installation
 *
 * Drupal:
 *
 *    Place this pantheon_rewrites.php file in sites/default
 *    Add the following to line 2 of settings.php
 *          // Include line for settings.php or wp-config.php
            $pantheon_rewrite_file = __DIR__ .  '/pantheon_rewrites.php';
            if(file_exists($pantheon_rewrite_file)) {
              include 'pantheon_rewrites.php';
            }
 *
 * Wordpress:
 *
 *    Place this pantheon_rewrites.php file in the same directory as wp-config.php, typically your docroot
 *    Add the following to line 2 of wp-config.php
 *          // Include line for settings.php or wp-config.php
            $pantheon_rewrite_file = __DIR__ .  '/pantheon_rewrites.php';
            if(file_exists($pantheon_rewrite_file)) {
              include 'pantheon_rewrites.php';
            }

/**
 * Page Redirects
 *
 * The following code provides redirect capabilities for your site. It should be noted that both Drupal and Wordpress
 * have modules and plugins that can replicate this capability, and we recommend using one of those, however, if your
 * use case will not allow that, here is an alternative for redirects.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *  To use page redirects, edit the $redirects array as follows, one redirect per line:
 *
 *    $redirects = [
 *        '/OLD_PATH' => '/NEW_PATH',
 *       '/SECOND_OLD_PATH' => '/SECOND_NEW_PATH',
 *    ]
 *

/**
 * URL Rewrites
 *
 * The following code provides mod_rewrite capabilities for your site. The following code will loop through the $mod_rewrite array
 * and proxy the new page without redirecting the user.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *  To use page rewrites, edit the mod_rewrites array as follows, one rewrite per line:
 *
 *    $mod_rewrites = [
 *        '/OLD_PATH' => '/NEW_PATH',
 *       '/SECOND_OLD_PATH' => '/SECOND_NEW_PATH',
 *    ]
